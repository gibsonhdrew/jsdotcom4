      Throughout America, women organized tea parties for meetings and fundraisers
      to support the suffrage movement. The Woman’s Suffrage Party sold ceylon,
      young hyson, gunpowder, and oolong tea under their charitable brand
      “Equality Tea.” Yet the history of tea is steeped in inequality, driven
      by colonialism, war, and appropriation. In her short film, <i>Equality Tea</i>,
      Jaime Sunwoo brews tea while drawing parallels between the fraught histories
      of the tea trade and the suffrage movement.
