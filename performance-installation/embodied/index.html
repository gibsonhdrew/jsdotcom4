      In <i>Embodied</i>, four performers repeat text verbatim as they listen to
      remixed audio tracks of fifty-five interviewees all responding to a
      single prompt: “Describe a time you were acutely aware of your race.”
      Surveillance cameras track their movements and wireless microphones
      manipulate their voices, capturing the insecurity, paranoia, and
      absurdity of life in America during mass social unrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Embodied</i> explores how we interpret messages when they’re being
      delivered by people with different race and gender identities–
      a survey of fears, defenses, and hopes as people struggle to
      understand their perceptions of self and others.
