      <i>You Are The News Now</i> explores the fragile balance of online reality during
      the United States’ COVID-19 crisis. Through parallel monologues sourced
      entirely from found text, the virus’s devastation comes into contrast with
      viral misinformation and conspiracy theories surrounding the virus’s origin,
      government lockdowns, masks, vaccination, and racial violence. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While the government and establishment media struggle to interpret the crisis
      for the online public, the mysterious “Q” and his army of citizen journalist
      “Digital Soldiers” wage war on the construction of truth itself. Co-created
      by Jaime Sunwoo and Matt Chilton. Commissioned by Ping Chong + Company.
