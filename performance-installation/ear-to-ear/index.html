      In <i>Ear to Ear</i>, artist Jaime Sunwoo welcomed passersby to press their ears
      against hers to listen to each other's inner sounds while taking turns 
      eating different textured foods. While one person sampled crunchy pretzels, 
      chewy gummy bears, and fizzy pop rocks, the other listened, getting a rare 
      glimpse into another person's physical perspective. The experience is playful 
      and intimate, an act of empathy through touch and sound. By pressing ears 
      together, sounds travel from one person to the other via bone conduction, 
      vibrations through the skull.

      <i>Ear to Ear</i> is an attempt to see 'eye to eye' with others. To protect ourselves, 
      we normally guard our senses around strangers. Strangers lack our trust and 
      intimacy so we tend to avoid eye contact, are quieter, and certainly do not 
      touch. Ear to Ear is a celebratory act to share the senses with someone you 
      are willing to trust just for a moment. Over eighty people participated in 
      the project during the Art in Odd Places Festival 2018. Videos of the encounters 
      were uploaded on Instagram under <b>#EartoEarNYC</b>.
