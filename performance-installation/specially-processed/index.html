      <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> is a performance film that explores Spam,
      the canned meat, as a portal into Jaime Sunwoo's Asian American upbringing
      and her family's experiences of the Korean War. The filmed stage production
      investigates Spam’s legacy in the US military and its significance during
      WWII in the Asia-Pacific– Korea, the Philippines, Okinawa, Hawaii, and Guam–
      through puppetry, masks, and original music played with kitchen instruments.
      Performers embody real people from Jaime's life and historical figures such
      as the Hormel Girls, who were women US veterans promoting Spam products
      through a 1950's traveling stage show, where this hybrid story takes place.
