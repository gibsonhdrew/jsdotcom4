    <p>
      <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> by Jaime Sunwoo is a surreal autobiographical
      performance using SPAM, the canned meat, as a portal into her Asian American
      upbringing and her family's experiences of the Korean War. 
      It investigates SPAM's legacy in the military, its significance in the
      Asia-Pacific, and its influence on Asian cuisine through music, shadowplay,
      and cooking. Oscillating wildly between absurd humor and sober tragedy,
      <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> is a thought-provoking exploration of
      one of America's most misunderstood foods. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to performances, <i>Specially Processed American Me</i> holds food history
      and storytelling workshops over a communal SPAM meal. To learn more, visit
